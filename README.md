# amanita

amanita is a Mycology compliant (Be)Funge-98 interpreter written in C++. This is largely an exercise in me finding something interesting, not necessarily trying to make the "best" interpreter.

An eventual editor and debugger is planned.

### Mycology

Currently, amanita passes the core of the Mycology test suite, and a small handful of fingerprints are implemented. Additional fingerprint support is planned, though the editor is taking priority.
